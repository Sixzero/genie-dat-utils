## Install

```
npm install genie-dat-utils
```

## Usage

```js
var genieDat = require('genie-dat-utils')
var buffer = require('fs').readFileSync('/path/to/empires2_x1_p1.dat')
genieDat.load(buffer, (err, dat) => {
  console.log(dat.civilizations.map(civ => civ.name))
})
```

## Supported Formats

The data file format differs slightly between game versions. Versions supported by this library are:

 - `aoc` - All AoC-style formats, such as `empires2_x1.dat` of AoC 1.0 and `empires2_x1_p1.dat` of AoC 1.0c (the most common version). UserPatch and UserPatch based mods like WololoKingdoms and Portuguese Civ Mod also use this format. HD Edition versions before 5.0 also use this format.
 - `african-kingdoms` - The release of African Kingdoms changed the file format slightly; HD Edition versions 5.0 and up use this format. Note that this is used regardless of whether the African Kingdoms DLC is actually installed.

## Limitations

Age of Kings, SWGB, and the AoE1 and AoE:DE files are not yet supported. The goal is to expand support for these formats in the future.

Still write/save functionality is not done, but can be easily implemented using the existing codes.

## API

`genieDat.load(buffer, opts={}, cb)`

Decompress and load `buffer`, eg. a raw .dat file.

`opts` can be an object with properties:

 - `version` - A version string listed under [Supported Formats](#supported-formats). Defaults to `aoede2`.

`cb` is a Node-style callback receiving `(err, dat)`.
`dat` is a plain object representing the dat file contents. `console.log()` it to find out what's in it. There is a lot of junk, some of the more useful properties are:

 - `playerColors` - Player colours, mostly offsets into the main [palette](https://github.com/genie-js/jascpal) file
 - `techs` - Technology effects
 - `terrains` - Lists terrains
 - `civilizations` - Lists available civilizations
   - `civilizations[i].objects` - Lists unit statistics for each civ
 - `researches` - Lists available researchesâ€”this refers to the technology effects a lot

### `genieDat.loadRaw(buffer, opts={}, cb)`

Load an already decompressed `buffer`. Use this if you manually did `zlib.inflateRaw` or got an uncompressed buffer through some other means. Otherwise it is identical to `genieDat.load`.

## This project is forked from

The original [genie-dat was forked by mrommel](https://github.com/mrommel/genie-dat#supported-formats), who made a lot of improvements, I could also fork that repo, but it would be confusing. Also for visibility purposes and to finally group efforts in portability of genie dat files, I propose this new github repository.

## Support

If newer version comes out from AoEDE2 we just copy the protocol from the official: [genieutils](https://github.com/Tapsa/genieutils)

## License

This project is based heavily on [genieutils](https://github.com/Tapsa/genieutils) by apreiml and Tapsa, and on the [openage](https://github.com/sfttech/openage) [conversion script](https://github.com/sfttech/openage/tree/master/openage/convert/gamedata).
